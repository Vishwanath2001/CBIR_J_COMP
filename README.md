 ## STEPS TO RUN THE CODE IN LOCAL SYSTEM
 1 First download the repo in local machine
 
 
 2 Create a virtual environment for dependencies this is done using 
    refer this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk&t=200s
    install the dependencies
    
    
    pip install numpy
    
    pip install pandas
    
    pip install matplotlib
    
    pip install opencv-python
    
    pip install tensorflow==2.7.0
    
    pip install Pillow
  
  Once it is done everything should be fine. Now make sure your dataset and code file is in the same folder like below image

4 Now run the traffic_sign.py to train the model(run it with command ```python traffic_sign.py```)

5 Similarly run gui.py
